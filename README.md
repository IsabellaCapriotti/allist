# Allist

A web app designed to do a better job than your memory at keeping track of all the things you currently want to watch, read, play, try, and listen to, so you don't forget 
the experiences you want to have and the art you want to enjoy! 

You can sign in to save, view, and edit all of the items you've added, mark them off as you finish them, and view an archive of all the items you've completed in the past. 

You can also opt in to display the items on your profile as you add them or complete them, allowing other users to see what you're currently interested in along
with a short status message when they navigate to your page.

The app also includes customizable color themes, which you can change from your profile page!
